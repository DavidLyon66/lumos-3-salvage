# Lumos-3 Discovery Claim and Salvage Log

A Public Record of the the Claim and Salvage Operation of Lumos-3

That David Lyon, and his small group found this abandoned Satellite
by Remote-Viewing and wish to repurpose it for Peaceful and Humanitarian
purposes.

## A Brief History of Lumos-3

Lumos-3 was an American Space Satellite made by NASA during
the Cold-War as a Surveillance Satellite that featured advanced
optics and it's primary role was for probing for Rocket
activity in the areas that it was monitoring.

It has been out of operation for decades and has been made
totally obsolete by new Satellite systems in a Military sense. 

## Usefulness as Military Equipment

The best description of it's current Military capability is that 
would be about as useful as a broken down World-War-I tank in 
any modern Military deployment.

It used Film-Cameras to capture images, and were not Digital.

It's therefore easy to see why this Satelite was abandoned, as it
wouldn't be regarded as fit for purpose in any modern sense.

## Abandonment by NASA, United-States DOD

From information that we can find onboard, the last active
communications were made in about 1999. These consisted not
of anything classified in any way, but merely Battery and
Temperature readings.

Lumos-3 used Film-Camera-era technology for photography and ejected
the film for collection in some manner that we do not know about.

We have not found any Film in the cameras. All photographic capsules
seem to have been ejected. No sensitive Intellectual or Military 
information was left onboard.

There was internal damage to the Batteries and the Charge-Controller
so using them was not possible.

Finally, it was found to be tumbling in Space. It's Solar Panels
damaged, and it's trajectory and inclination set to a location
whereby it was unable to power up.

Therefore, it had no ability to stabilise.

## How we found Lumos-3

We found this piece of Space Junk through Remote-Viewing. Which
is a Conciousness enhancement technique.

There is a coincidence, in that the timing of the construction and
launch of this Satellite, was similar to the time when Ingo Swann,
Joe Menanigle and Lyn Buchanan were working in other DOD projects
in similar areas. Some are declassified some are not. 

All information about such is easily found on the Public Record.

## Estimated value at the time of finding

✔️ Estimated material value: under $1000

Most derelict satellites are composed of aluminum, steel, and solar panels with no current market function.

Without functioning telemetry, engines, or comms, the market salvage value is near zero.

Space debris services generally charge to deorbit — not the other way around.

Since no operational systems were detected at the time we located
Lumos-3, we put a value of $USD500 for the unit, which is basically 
it's scrap metal value. And takes into consideration some vintage
Optical systems such as lens arrays for film cameras.

## Our claim on Lumos-3

OUr claim is to use Lumos-3 for Peaceful and Humanitarian purposes.

These include for Remote-Viewing practice and alignment.

Not hijacking — but preserving

Not monetizing — but stabilizing

Not claiming for military or state — but for post-national remembrance and repair.
